| help_content | &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is EPI?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    &lt;b&gt;EPI&lt;/b&gt; is an abbreviation for &lt;b&gt;electronic product information.&lt;/b&gt; It is an electronic version of the paper    Product Information leaflet you typically find inside a pharmaceutical product package. In some cases, the    &lt;b&gt;EPI&lt;/b&gt; may have replaced the paper leaflet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    &lt;b&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is PharmaLedger?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PharmaLedger Association (PLA) is a not-for-profit association based in Switzerland with the purpose to enable    and foster a Digital Trust Ecosystem in healthcare through a standardized and trusted open-source platform. PLA    promotes collaboration and accelerates innovation and adoption to achieve mutual benefits in the healthcare and life    science domains for patients and other stakeholders. PLA was formed in 2022 to continue the work of the PharmaLedger    project, a 3-year project funded by the European Commission and the pharmaceutical industry aimed at proving the    value of blockchain solutions. Further information is available at https://pharmaledger.org.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is the DataMatrix?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a type of barcode on your product package. It is a black and white square box barcode and will look similar to    this:&lt;br&gt;    &lt;img src="./images/barcode_example.png" alt='DataMatrix barcode example'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    &lt;b&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to use the App?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Follow the instructions on the landing page of the &lt;b&gt;App...&lt;/b&gt; it shows a picture of where to find the    &lt;b&gt;DataMatrix&lt;/b&gt; on your    Product Package. Once you have found the &lt;b&gt;DataMatrix&lt;/b&gt;, click the button 'Scan &lt;b&gt;DataMatrix&lt;/b&gt;'. Allow the    application to    use the camera so the &lt;b&gt;DataMatrix&lt;/b&gt; can be scanned. Use the camera to focus on the &lt;b&gt;DataMatrix&lt;/b&gt;. Once the    pack is scanned    successfully, the &lt;b&gt;EPI&lt;/b&gt; will be displayed. You can click the '+' button to get more details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why does my DataMatrix scan not give a result?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    There are several reasons why the &lt;b&gt;DataMatrix&lt;/b&gt; on your package may not give an EPI. One of the reasons could be    the    focus for the camera. Please try to scan the code in a well lit place and code clearly visible on the screen. If you    are struggling to keep your hand steady, you could try using a table to support your hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; | ok | 41 |
